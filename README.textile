h2. Dr. Funk

This is a tool for writing and managing functional/acceptance tests. It can also be used to mark progress while manually testing an application.

A live demo is available at "http://funk.heroku.com":http://funk.heroku.com.

h2. Purpose

Working with acceptance tests can be a fairly draining process, but the value they carry is significant.

Dr. Funk eases the burden by:
* Making test steps simple to manage and edit
* Keeping organization flexible
* Leaving formatting up to the editor
* Tracking manual testing progress

h2. Not so obvious features

*HTML output* - Click the HTML link for any plan for customer sharable HTML output. 

*Step tracking* - Once inside a scenario, press the up/down arrow keys to highlight the step you are currently testing. Press Esc to stop tracking.

*Test failures* - Marking failures is done by editing a step and using the following syntax:

<pre>
The popup is displayed
.failure with the text "Funky!"
</pre>
 
Failures have to start on a new line as shown above. Multiple failures for a single step is fine. Once marked, they will show up on the list of Test Failures for a plan.

h2. Installation

Dr. Funk requires Rails 2.3.3
<pre>
rake gems:install
cp config/database.sample.yml config/database.yml
rake db:create:all
rake db:schema:load
</pre>
